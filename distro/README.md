# Berd bundled app defaults

`distro/` contains generic resources and defaults that ship with the single Berd app build. It is not a customer/org profile system.

## Supported files

- `distro.json` — minimal bundled manifest for app-level defaults that still need to be available before runtime config owns them
- `config.yaml` — optional Goose config passed to `goose serve`
- `bin/` — optional executables or helper scripts prepended to `PATH` for `goose serve`
- `skills/` — bundled skills seeded into the user's global skills directory
- `agents/` — bundled agents seeded into the user's global agents directory

## Discovery

The Tauri app resolves bundled defaults in this order:

1. `GOOSE_DISTRO_DIR`, if set
2. bundled Tauri resource dir at `resource_dir()/distro`

In development, `just dev` exports `GOOSE_DISTRO_DIR` to this repository's `distro/` directory when it exists.

## Manifest shape

`distro.json` is optional. The public-shaped build does not commit a Block
route manifest; an internal build may stage one into the packaged distro root.
For local testing, a manifest can supply generic `http`/`https` values:

```json
{
  "kgoose": {
    "baseUrl": "https://kgoose.example.test/",
    "path": "example/goose"
  },
  "marketplace": {
    "skillUrlTemplate": "https://marketplace.example.test/skills/{skillId}"
  }
}
```

### Fields

- `appVersion?: string`
  - optional app version tag supplied by bundled defaults
- `marketplace?: { skillUrlTemplate: string }`
  - optional URL template used to open a skill in the distribution's marketplace
  - must use HTTPS, include a host, and contain exactly one `{skillId}` placeholder
  - `{skillId}` may appear in the path or query, but not in the URL authority (userinfo, host, or port)
  - must not include credentials or a fragment
- `kgoose?: { baseUrl?: string, path?: string }`
  - generic default KGoose endpoint used by KGoose-backed features until runtime config owns this source
  - `baseUrl` must use `http` or `https`
  - environment variables `KGOOSE_BASE_URL` and `KGOOSE_SERVICE_PATH` override these values for local testing

## Runtime effects

`config.yaml` supplies the Goose context defaults: `GOOSE_CONTEXT_LIMIT: 272000`
and `GOOSE_AUTO_COMPACT_THRESHOLD: 0.9`. These are fallback values, not enforced
policy: Goose loads the user's config after the bundled file and environment
variables take precedence over both. Behavior settings save changes through
ACP to the user's config, never to this bundled file. The context limit is an
override, not an increase in the selected model's supported context window.

When bundled defaults are present, the Tauri shell:

- prepends `distro/bin` to `PATH` when present
- adds `distro/config.yaml` to `GOOSE_ADDITIONAL_CONFIG_FILES` when present
- sets `GOOSE_DISTRO_DIR` to the resolved distro root
- uses `kgoose` as the generic default endpoint for KGoose-backed features
- installs Berd-owned `distro/skills/<name>/` entries into the platform app-data `skills/<name>/` directory; Personal skills remain in `~/.agents/skills`
- installs `distro/agents/<name>.md` entries into `~/.agents/agents/<name>.md`
- warms installed bundled agent `app-avatar:` media when network access is available

Bundled skills reinstall existing copies only when the installed `SKILL.md` frontmatter has the `metadata.berdBundled: true` marker. For existing installs, the app still recognizes the legacy `metadata.gooseInternalBundled: true` marker. After the new Berd-owned copy is verified, marker-owned legacy copies under `~/.agents/skills` move to the platform app-data `recovery/skills-migration-v1` directory; existing recovery data and all unmarked Personal skills are left untouched.

Bundled agents use the `metadata.berdBundled: true` marker. The app records seeded files in `.berd-bundled-agents.json` so deleted starter agents do not reappear on later launches, and migrates the legacy `.goose-internal-bundled-agents.json` marker when present. For existing installs, the app still recognizes legacy `metadata.gooseInternalBundled: true` agent frontmatter. Existing unmarked user agents are left untouched.

## Scope guidance

Use bundled app defaults for generic packaged-app resources and shell-level startup defaults only.

Good fits:

- bundled skills
- bundled agents
- app-local Goose `config.yaml`
- bundled `bin/`
- temporary generic app defaults that cannot yet move to runtime config

Do not use bundled app defaults for customer/org/workspace policy, customer-specific package identities, provider allowlists, feedback policy, doctor policy, runtime feature toggles, normal app state, user preferences, ACP-backed data, or per-user experiments. Customer/org/workspace behavior should come from auth and runtime/server config.
